# halogenki
*A darkroom notepad for nerds who still use classic silver-based photo process.*

## What is this and why I do this?
Because of fact, that I'm a big fan of classic darkroom photography, 
I work on a web app that helps to keep on eye quantities of available 
photographic materials, film development details, and chemistry recipes. 
This is a hobby project that I work on in my free time.

## What is the meaning of the word *"halogenki"* and how to pronounce it?
Halogenki is a polish translation of word halides. 
Silver halides (in polish language: *"halogenki srebra"*) 
are light-sensitive chemicals that are commonly used in photographic 
film and paper.

## At what stage is the project currently?
The app is in the stage of choosing the right tools and early database design.
